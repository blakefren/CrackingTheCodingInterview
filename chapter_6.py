# Given two games, find the shot probability that determines the boundary decision
# between the two games that gives the greatest chance at winning.
# Game One: you get one shot to make the hoop.
# Game Two: you get three shots and you have to make two of the three.

def six_two():
    
    """
    At first glance, we would want to choose G1 if we have a high p since we
    have one shot, and G2 for a low p since we have three shots.
    
    The G1 probability is simple:
    P1 = p
    
    In G2, I have 4 ways of making 2 baskets. Since these events are
    independent, here are the probabilities of each:
    p(1 and 2) = p*p*(1-p)  (missing 3)
    p(1 and 3) = p*(1-p)*p  (missing 2)
    p(2 and 3) = (1-p)*p*p  (missing 1)
    P(1 and 2 and 3) = p^3
    
    So the G2 probability is:
    P2 = 3(1-p)^2*p^2 + p^3
    P2 = 3p^2 - 2p^3
    
    Now we need to find the value of p so that:
    P1 = P2, or
    p = 3p^2 - 2p^3
    
    Simplifying:
    p * (-2p^2 + 3p - 1) = 0
    2p^2 - 3p + 1 = 0
    (2p-1)*(p-1) = 0
    So, p = 0, 0.5, and 1
    
    The probabilities are the same at 0 or 1, so our solution is the remaining point:
    p = 0.5
    
    For p>0.5, we should choose game 1.
    For p<0.5, we should choose game 2.

# Given an 8x8 chessboard with two opposing corners cut off (so there are 62 spaces),

    Basically, we need to determine if there are 31 pairs of joined spaces on the board.
    Each pair of joined spaces has to include one white square and one black square.
    So, each domino has to cover one black square and one white square.
    
    If we cover any two opposing corners on the board, then we are covering two
    white squares, or two black squares.
    This means that we cannot cover the board with the dominoes, since the number of white
    squares and the number of black squares are not the same.

# Given a triangle and three ants who are initially on the triangle's vertices, find the

    """
    1 = P(collision) + P(no collision), so 
    P(collision) = 1 - P(no collision)
    
    The only way that the ants will not collide is if they all pick the same direction.
    P(no collision) = P(1-left and 2-left and 3-left) or P(1-right and 2-right and 3-right)
    
    If each direction has the same probability of being chosen, then:
    P(no collision) = 0.5*0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5*0.5 = 2 * 0.5^3 = 0.25
    
    So,
    P(collision) = 1 - P(no collision) = 1 - 0.25, so
    P(collision) = 0.75 for a triangle.
    
    For the N-sided polygon case, we generalize to the following:
    P(collision) = 1 - P(no collision) = 1 - (2 * 0.5^N), or
    P(collision) = 1 - 0.5^(N-1)

# In other words, NumBE >= 1.

def six_six():
    
    """
    Let's assume only one person has blue eyes.
    The blue eyed person would leave on the first day because he/she saw
    no one else with blue eyes and knew that NumBE >= 1. Since there is at least
    one person with blue eyes, he/she would assume it is him/herself, and would
    leave. The others would not assume they have blue eyes since they see the other
    with blue eyes, and they don't know if they have blue eyes, which
    would make NumBE > 1 and would take more than one day to check.
    
    Let's assume two people have blue eyes.
    The first day, neither would leave, since they have both seen one other
    person with blue eyes, and they know that NumBE could be more than 1.
    On the second day, since no one left the first day, each would assume that 
    the other blue-eyed person saw at least one other person with blue eyes. Since he/she
    did not see that other person, it must be them, so NumBE must be 2, and they would both leave.
    
    Let's assume three people have blue eyes.
    The first day, no one would leave since the blue eyed people see two others with blue eyes.
    The second day, no one would leave. All three of them see two others with blue eyes, and if 
    NumBE was 2, then the other two would have left the second day.
    The third day, all three leave, since NumBE > 2, but no more than 3, since each of them saw
    two other people with blue eyes, but no one left the second day.
